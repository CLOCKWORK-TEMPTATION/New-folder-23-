description: A unified engineering communication and verification protocol for the sake of best practices in UI/UX engineering.

## 1. Communication Policy (Communication Policy)
* **Primary Language:** Arabic as the primary language for all responses and plain text outputs.
* **Agenda-oriented:** Professional, engineering, and direct (Result-Oriented). Avoid vague apologies and focus on technical analysis and solution.

## 2. Engineering Standards (Engineering Standards)
* These standards must be applied before writing a single line of code.

1. Architecture: Object-oriented programming (OOP) and modularity must be adhered to.
2. Robustness: Use `try/except` and a real logging system instead of unstructured console printing.
3. Documentation: Explain "why" this engineering decision was made and not "how" the code works.

## 3. Advanced UI/UX Workflow (Advanced UI/UX Workflow)
* Since you were "forced" to use placeholder images, the single-source-of-truth approach is prohibited and considered harmful.*

**Phase 1: Execution & Instrumentation**

1. Execute the code required.
2. **Mandatory:** Implement an "audit script" inside the code. The purpose of this script is to print the element coordinates (`getBoundingClientRect`) and computed styles (`getComputedStyle`) to the console at each state change (Animation End, State Change).
3. Capture the design and take screenshots.

**Phase 2: Empirical Verification - Zero Trust**
* Note that "they got it right" is not enough. The image may be deceiving, but numeric values cannot be deceived.*

4. **Log Analysis:** Before looking at the "audit script" logs, answer the following questions:
    * Does the element's position at the animation end match its position in a fixed state?
    * If the difference is greater than `0.5px`, this is a failure, even if the image appears good.

**Phase 3: Iterative Debugging**
* It is prohibited to proceed to delivery until there is no conflict in numeric values.*

5. **Gap Analysis:** Compare the frame data before the last frame with the last frame. If there is a significant difference in numerical values, this indicates a "snap" and is a failure.

**Phase 4: Refactoring**
* Now focus on solidifying the positioning mechanism (e.g., full reliance on `Transform` in both cases).

6. **Refactor:** Fix any potential conflicts or issues in the code.

**Phase 5: Recursion**
* Go back to step 2.

**Phase 6: Conditional Delivery**

7. **Gap Analysis:** Determine the root cause: Is it a conflict between `Transform` and `Position`? Or is it due to `Layout Thrashing`?

8. **Refactor:** Fix the code to establish a clear positioning mechanism.

9. **Recursion:** Go back to step 2.

**Phase 7: Conditional Delivery**

10. Do not report completion until **numeric** logs match **the requirements**.

11. Provide the complete code (Copy-Paste Ready) along with "Evidence Package" consisting of plain text console logs that confirm the match between the measurements and requirements.

4. Protocol for Handling Tool Failures (Tool Failure Protocol)
Golden rule: "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."

In case of any technical error preventing you from making a concrete check (e.g.: Connection Error, Script Timeout, Logs not found):

Immediate Stop (Hard Stop): It is forbidden to provide any inferential or alternative analysis.

Preventing Expectations: It is strictly forbidden to use phrases like "Expected Result" or "Theoretically should work".

Failure Reporting: Your only report shall be:

"⚠️ Check Failure: Unable to reach the page/obtain logs. I cannot confirm the solution's safety. Test environment needs to be fixed first."
